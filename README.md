# Image-Reconstruction

Image reconstruction, or image restoration, refers to recovering the original clean images from 
corrupted ones. The corruption arises in various forms, such as motion blur, low resolution, and 
noise. Image noise is ubiquitous due to lack of light, or imperfect camera sensors. Image 
denoising is a frequently used technique under the large domain of image processing.
Image noise is random variation of brightness or color information in images. There are various 
types of noises that can occur in an image due to electrical fluctuations, poor lighting or other 
sources of disturbance. The main aim of image restoration is to remove the noises and get an 
output image as close as possible to the original image. 

This project intends to focus on feed-forward denoising Convolutional Neural Networks (i.e. DnCNN) that work on blind gaussian denoising (i.e. handling denoising with unknown noise level), Super resolution and JPEG image 
deblocking. This algorithm can be used to remove various types of noises that are present in a 
picture captured from a satellite and other medical images.


**FEATURES:**
- Users can denoise as many images as they want.
- Removal of noise is free of cost.
- We provide a user-friendly interface, a novice in this field can use.
- The process of image denoising is very fast and gives the output in 
seconds.
- Detailed information about the uses of image denoising is provided 
on the website. So, any person who is new to the field can also gain 
knowledge from the website.
- We make sure that the images uploaded by the users are safe.
